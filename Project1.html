                    Pratap Singh I, popularly known as Maharana Pratap (c. 9 May 1540 – 19 January 1597), was a Hindu Rajput king of Mewar from the Sisodia dynasty. He fought several major battles against Akbar including the Battle of Haldighati in 1576 to resist the expansionist policy of the Mughal empire. Pratap became a folk hero for his military resistance through guerrilla warfare which proved inspirational for later rebels against Mughals including Malik Ambar and Shivaji.

                  <h3>Early life and accession</h3>
          
                  <p>
                    Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai Singh ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh. His younger brothers were Shakti Singh, Vikram Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had 2 stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. He was married to Maharani Ajabde Punwar of Bijolia Amar Singh I. He belonged to the Royal Family of Mewar. After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai wanted her son Jagmal to succeed him but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the nobles prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the Sisodia Rajputs. Jagmal swore revenge and left for Ajmer, to join the armies of Akbar, and obtained the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return for his help.

                  <h3>Military career</h3>
                  <h4>Background</h4>
                  <p>
                    In stark contrast to other Rajput rulers who accommodated and formed alliances with the various Muslim dynasties in the subcontinent, by the time Pratap ascended to the throne, Mewar was going through a long standing conflict with the Mughals which started with the defeat of his grandfather Rana Sanga in the Battle of Khanwa in 1527 and continued with the defeat of his father Udai Singh II in Siege of Chittorgarh in 1568.Pratap Singh, gained distinction for his refusal to form any political alliance with the Mughal Empire and his resistance to Muslim domination. The conflicts between Pratap Singh and Akbar led to the Battle of Haldighati.

                  <h3>Reconquest of Mewar</h3>
          
                  <p>
                    Mughal pressure on Mewar relaxed after 1579 following rebellions in Bengal and Bihar and Mirza Hakim's incursion into the Punjab. After this, Akbar sent Abdul Rahim Khan-i-Khanan to invade Mewar but he stopped at Ajmer. In 1582, Pratap Singh attacked and occupied the Mughal post at Dewair (or Dewar) in the Battle of Dewair.[unreliable source?] This led to the automatic liquidation of all 36 Mughal military outposts in Mewar. After this Akbar sent Jagannath Kachhwaha to invade Mewar in 1584. This time too Mewar army defeated Mughals and forced them to retreat. In 1585, Akbar moved to Lahore and remained there for the next twelve years watching the situation in the north-west. No major Mughal expedition was sent to Mewar during this period. Taking advantage of the situation, Pratap recovered most of Mewar (except its former capital), Chittorgarh and Mandalgarh regions by defeating Mughal forces there. During this period, he also built a new capital, Chavand, near modern Dungarpur

                  <h3>Death</h3>
                  <p>
                    Reportedly, Pratap died of injuries sustained in a hunting accident, at Chavand on 19 January 1597,aged 56. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Amar Singh I. On his death bed, Pratap told his son never to submit to the Mughals and to win Chittor back
